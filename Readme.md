# Hello there, I'm gone to tell about this repo.

Here I will upload exercises and examples about C# Windows Forms. Is this what I'm learning right now at the university.

### Controls

Examples about the most basic controls and the interactions we can do with them. 

### Recursive functions

Like I said before, functions calling them self.

### Data Structures

About this matter, I will handle just the dinamic and non-lineal structures like _queues, stacks, linked lists_ and _threes_.

note: the description of each exercise will be inside of the code or in a txt if u want to check them.

Thank you for reading this! :wink:
